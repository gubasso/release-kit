# Task: recover

Return a release to the normal path with the smallest fix that works. The gate picks it where something broke or stalled, and the symptom comes from the release state, never from the request's wording. Follow `rk method recovery` for the path of each symptom, by its section.

## Pre-flight

1. Read `symptoms` from `rk release status --target . --json`. Each one carries its `code`, its `evidence`, and the `recovery` section that owns its path.
2. Where the request names a problem only a person can judge, a defective version, a changelog that shipped wrong, CI down while the release cannot wait, or a release that must not ship, take it as a reported symptom. Never guess one the request does not name.
3. Where no symptom is detected and none is reported, the run is done: report the state.

## Execution

Take the smallest recovery that returns to the normal path. Never operate on a tag, a published version, or the trunk: a published version is permanent, so the way out is a newer version.

| Symptom                                                    | The recovery                                                                                                                                                    |

| `published-no-artifacts` or `artifact-without-attestation` | re-run the artifact workflow on the same tag, as a release action                                                                                               |
| a defective version                                        | fix forward through the project's own workflow and the `release` task, then withdraw the bad version with the registry's own step and the operator's credential |
| a changelog that shipped wrong                             | amend the changelog on the trunk through the project's own workflow; it ships with the next release                                                             |
| CI down, and the release cannot wait                       | the three-move hand-publish, with enforcement off first, all the operator's                                                                                     |
| a release that must not ship, its request still open       | the hold of the `release` task                                                                                                                                  |
| a release that must not ship, its request already merged   | a defective version, above                                                                                                                                      |
| an older line that needs the fix                           | the `lines` task                                                                                                                                                |

A credential is always the operator's. Turning enforcement off, publishing by hand, and withdrawing a version are printed for the operator unless the request names them.

## Post-flight

1. Run `rk release status --target . --json`, and confirm the symptom is gone.
2. A hand-published release carries no provenance until its artifact workflow re-runs on its tag once CI is back. List that re-run under "Still the operator's" in the report until it runs.
3. Fill the report's evidence line as `release` does, or `failed: <symptom>` where the symptom stays.
